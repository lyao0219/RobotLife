RobotLife is an FPS game developed to conduct a study on *"Situated Visualization in Motion in the Context of Video Games"*. 
RobotLife has three different visualization designs embedded to understand the impact of visualization's readability and aesthetic, as well as gaming tasks and gaming context on user experience.
RobotLife contains an introduction phase, a tutorial part, and three experiment blocks.
Each experiment block is composed of a training session, a trial session, and an in-game questionnaire. 

## How can I open the project?
To open RobotLife, you should first have Unity 3D and Unity Hub installed on your machine. Please refer to the Unity official installation guidelines: https://unity.com/download.
Once your Unity 3D and Unity Hub are ready, you can open the project by clicking on the "Open" button in the Unity Hub and selecting the entire folder called "RobotLife-08032023".
You might need to be patient and wait for a while to Unity create a work environment and install all packages required. The processing speed depends on your machine's performance and your internet connection.

## From where should I start to learn?
RobotLife was developed by extending an official FPS Microgame template published by Unity Learn. 
To better understand which component does what function, please refer to the official tutorial: https://learn.unity.com/project/fps-template.

## How can I modify the study settings?
Study setting scripts, including participant ID, in-game questionnaire, training, and test trials, can be found in the Folder "Assets".
