# Visualization in motion - *RobotLife*

This is a repository for original codes of the video games, *RobotLife*, used as a testbed in the paper ["User Experience of Visualizations in Motion: A Case Study and Design Considerations"](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2024.3456319), published at [IEEE Transactions of Visualization and Computer Graphics](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tg) and presented at [IEEE Visualization 2024](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/welcome).
*RobotLife* allows players to play a first-person shooting game with different visualizations in motion.

If you use *RobotLife* and our results on **Visualization in motion** in new projects or use it in a different way, we would appreciate a citation:

## Getting started

To get started, either clone this repository, or if you stay within github, use the ''use this template'' function to generate your own version of this repository from which you can then edit. You will see the project hierachgy as follows:

```
└── Main directory
    ├── RobotLife
    ├── LICENSE
    └── README.md
```

*RobotLife* was implemented based on the [Unity FPS template](https://learn.unity.com/project/fps-template).
You first need to download and install the [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub). Next, you open the entire folder "RobotLife" that you obtain here as a project in the Unity Hub.
Until this step, you should be able to interact with the project.

## Go further

Here, we additionally provide instructions on where you should look if you want to modify the game and the experiment settings.

"FPS" is the main folder containing important things: 

```
└── InitManager.cs
    ├── set participants ID
    ├── call “SceneFlowManager.cs” to initialize the condition list
    ├── start trial & & create files for recording answers & questionnaires

└── QuestionnaireToggleGroups:
    ├── get likert answers

└── QuestionnaireManager.cs:
    ├── set questionnaire’s UI and greetings according to the condition

└── QuestionnaireLikert.cs:
    ├── send likert answers & update UI

└── TrainingManagers.cs:
    ├── initialize buttons

└── check answers
    ├── go to the next training
    ├── destroy the current one

└── TrainingButton.cs:
    ├── identify whether the enemy is evil or not
