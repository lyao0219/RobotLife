# Visualization in motion - *RobotLife*

This is a repository for original codes of the video games, *RobotLife*, used as a testbed in the paper ["User Experience of Visualizations in Motion: A Case Study and Design Considerations"](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2024.3456319), published at [IEEE Transactions of Visualization and Computer Graphics](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tg) and presented at [IEEE Visualization 2024](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/welcome).
*RobotLife* allows players to play a first-person shooting game with different visualizations in motion.

If you use *RobotLife* and our results on **Visualization in motion** in new projects or use it in a different way, we would appreciate a citation:
